## Search Engine Optimisation(SEO)

### Meta tags

In the head of base.html, <meta name="description" ... and <meta name="keywords" ... tags were included.

### Keywords

On home page small introduction contains almost all keywords which are inlcuded in 
<meta name="keywords" content="tea, your tea, catch, best selections, black tea, green tea, white tea, pure, mango, jasmine, lemongrass, ceylon, earl grey, yunnan, gift, benefits, online shop, drinking, healthy tea, leaves, chinese, china, health, unique,taste, shopping, store"


For searching keywords I used the website [Wordtracker](https://www.wordtracker.com/). However site didn't show me an interesting options. The website wasn't very helpful in my case.

### Newsletter Signup Form

For email marketing I used The MailChimp Newsletter subscription service. It is ideal for online business and it is free and simple to set up. The newsletter subscription is completely optional for customers. The service is represented on the site in the footer as a small form with email required field.
